### **Exercise 1: Basic Line Plot**
Create a simple line plot.

**Task**:
- Plot `y = 2x + 5` for `x` ranging from `-10` to `10`.
- Add title, x-label, and y-label.

*Why it matters*: If you can’t plot a basic line, you’re missing the whole point of data visualization.

---

### **Exercise 2: Multiple Line Plots**
Plot more than one line on the same graph.

**Task**:
- Plot `y1 = x`, `y2 = x^2`, and `y3 = x^3` for `x` in the range `0` to `5`.
- Differentiate the lines using color and line style. Include a legend.

*Why it matters*: Data rarely exists in isolation. Comparing variables side by side is key.

---

### **Exercise 3: Scatter Plot**
Create a scatter plot to visualize relationships between variables.

**Task**:
- Generate 50 random `(x, y)` pairs using `numpy`.
- Plot a scatter plot with different colors for the points.

*Why it matters*: Scatter plots are the bread and butter of identifying correlations.

---

### **Exercise 4: Bar Chart**
Visualize categorical data using a bar chart.

**Task**:
- Plot a bar chart of 5 products (A, B, C, D, E) with sales values [10, 20, 30, 15, 25].

*Why it matters*: Bar charts quickly expose winners and losers in any comparison.

---

### **Exercise 5: Histogram**
Show the distribution of data using a histogram.

**Task**:
- Generate 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution and plot a histogram with 50 bins.

*Why it matters*: Histograms are the simplest way to see how data spreads.

---

### **Exercise 6: Pie Chart**
Create a pie chart to represent parts of a whole.

**Task**:
- Make a pie chart for the market share of four companies: A (40%), B (25%), C (20%), D (15%).

*Why it matters*: Pie charts are overused but still necessary for visualizing parts of a whole.

---

### **Exercise 7: Subplots**
Visualize different plots on the same figure using subplots.

**Task**:
- Create a 2x2 grid of plots: 
  1. Line plot of `y = sin(x)`
  2. Line plot of `y = cos(x)`
  3. Scatter plot of `x` vs. `y` (random values)
  4. Bar chart of product sales

*Why it matters*: Real-world data stories are complex—subplots bring them together.

---

### **Exercise 8: Customize Plot Style**
Experiment with customizing plot style.

**Task**:
- Plot `y = sin(x)` for `x` in the range of `0` to `2π`. Customize the color, line style, and markers. Add a grid.

*Why it matters*: Default plots are boring. Customization turns information into a visual asset.

---

### **Exercise 9: Stacked Bar Chart**
Visualize multiple categories in the same bar using stacking.

**Task**:
- Create a stacked bar chart with 3 groups (A, B, C), each with values for three categories (X, Y, Z).

*Why it matters*: This visualization makes a compact comparison easy to understand.

---

### **Exercise 10: Heatmap**
Visualize a 2D matrix of values using a heatmap.

**Task**:
- Create a 6x6 matrix of random values and plot a heatmap using `imshow()`.

*Why it matters*: Heatmaps are fantastic for spotting intensity, trends, or clusters in data.
